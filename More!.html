                    My name is Carlos Russell and I am a creator for the brand Three Two Clothing, also known as Thirty Two Clothing. My main goal in life is to be as successful as possible, no matter what it takes. My parents have always stressed to me that if youre comfortable in what youre doing then you arent doing it right, theres always a way to better yourself. A big thing for me recently is growth and being apart of COMARTSCI major has helped me grow in an educational way .
